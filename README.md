# Explanation of GIT
Very important: I prefer coding and just working overall in English. That said,
this is an introduction to my GIT, and how I work with it!

## Branches
I work with branches, because that's how I learned how to work. I mostly use
only a *master* (*main*) and *development* branch. There'll be some other
branches maybe, but that's a small chance. I mostly work on the *development*
branch, because that's what you're supposed to do. This is where you'll find the
latest work a lot of the time, except for some exceptions, such as at the end/
start of a new module.

### *master*
Branch with the latest "main" update. Every module I merge *development* into
this, with all of the workshops and exercises I've done.

### *development*
Branch with the latest workshops, exercises and bugfixes I've done. This is
where you'll need to be to check up on things in the middle of the module.

### Module branches
Module branches will be new in the next push. I will make a completely new
branch where you can find all of the progress so far for module 3.

## Changelogs
I've worked with changelogs for the last couple months, and I think it works
fine, but only for me. This is why I will make this into just 1 changelog.
This way it's not necessary to check multiple changelogs. I will delete the
existing changelog files, and update this file (*README.md*) when I push
something. It will be above this explanation.

## Patches/ Pushes
Until now every time I've pushed something, I've added it to the changelog
under the name of patches. I'll keep doing this.

### Explanation of naming of patches
Like a lot of programs, I will use the typical 0.0 method of naming patches.
I don't know if the way I do it is normal or not, so I will explain it here.

There will be 4 numbers with dots between them. So like this: 0.0.0.0
- The first number will symbolise how many "main" patches there have been,
meaning mostly what module this is.
- The second number will symbolise how many "big" patches there have been,
usually the amount of workshops & exercises.
- The third number will symbolise how many "small" patches there have been,
so this will go up when I make a small feature for a workshop/ exercise.
- And lastly, the fourth number will symbolise how many bugfixes or minor
changes there have been. I obviously hope this will continue to stay very low.

##### The end?
This is the end of this file, but it's going to keep moving down, so it's not
really the end. Anyways, thanks for reading! :)
