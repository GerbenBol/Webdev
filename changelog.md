- This changelog has been added and filled with information about the latest patch.

2. .gitignore
- A .gitignore file has been added to the project to ignore certain files when pushing.

3. "projects" folder
- A wild new folder has appeared! In this folder will be stored the different projects we're going to make over the following year(s). Contains module subfolders.

4. "portfolio" folder | **Has changelog**
- This folder is the biggest project I've run in these lessons, because I wanted to. I've been making and styling a website with multiple pages to show my progress and exercises.

5. "module_1" folder
- This folder has been made for the exercises (workshops) we had to make in module 1.

6. "workshop_1" folder
- This folder contains the project named "workshop_1"/My First Webpage. We had to make a very simple webpage which was, as expected, quite simple.

7. "workshop_3" folder
- This folder contains the project named "workshop_3"/Stylen van je webpagina. It was a pretty interesting project, which showed me some interesting new features that I didn't know about until now.

8. "documentation" folder | **Has changelog**
- A wild new folder has appeared! In this folder will be stored the different documents I'll make for the different projects we're going to be doing. Of course not for every project will be documentation, keep that in mind.

9. "changelogs" folder
- A wild new folder has appeared! In this folder will be stored the changelogs I've made for the Git. Keep in mind, not all changelogs will be sent here. Only this changelog will get back-ups in this folder, to let people also see the past patches.

------------------------------

### **NOTE:**
Some projects will have changelogs for the projects themselves, and those will go into more detail/depth about the changes in their projects.

### **EXTRA NOTE:**
SOME projects will have this, not all of them. I will note which projects have changelogs.

End of changelog, thanks for reading!
