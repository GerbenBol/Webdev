# *Explanation of project*
------------------------------
I've started this project because I was bored, and thus decided to just start working
on a random webpage I could show. When I was put to work on some harder exercises I
decided to make a portfolio out of it. I'm going to style it as I like it, and using
Bootstrap is nice, so I don't have to make a carousel view out of nothing (for example).
It's also an exercise for my JavaScript skills, which for now is looking a bit rough.
