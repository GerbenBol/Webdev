# *Explanation of project*
------------------------------
I've started this project because I was bored, and thus decided to just start working on a random webpage I could show. When I was put to work on some harder exercises I decided to make a portfolio out of it. I'm going to style it as I like it, and using Bootstrap is nice, so I don't have to make a carousel view out of nothing (for example). It's also an exercise for my JavaScript skills, which for now is looking a bit rough.

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Workshop 4
- I did a lot of work for workshop 4. The game is now playable, and you can win and draw. I'm working on a couple of extra features now, but after that I'm going to do something else. I don't know what yet.

That marks the end of this patch, thanks for reading!

## **Patch: 3.3.2.0**
*Branch: development*

------------------------------

### *Changes this patch:*
1. Groupsexercise module 3
1. Module 4 Workshop 1
1. Module 4 Workshop 2
1. Module 4 Workshop 3
1. Module 4 Workshop 4

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Groupsexercise
- We made a groupsexercise, which was a full on project with a team. We were a good team, and together we made an amazing site, which was satisfying for the customer.

2. Workshop 1
- An easy exercise which introduces JavaScript variables, but I already knew those.

3. Workshop 2
- Another easy exercise which is making a piano working with sounds.

4. Workshop 3
- This exercise was a bit harder than the previous two, we had to make a calculator. It didn't take me very long, but it was a good exercise nonetheless.

5. Workshop 4
- I started working on workshop 4, which is an optional workshop. It's making a game of noughts and crosses, which is pretty fun.

## **Patch: 2.4.7.5**
*Branch: development*

------------------------------

### *Changes this patch:*
1. WitWub

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. WitWub
- I have added the possibility to filter your products based on brand, memory, memory type, and maximum resolution. Price and length don't work, because that's a bit harder to code, and I don't have the time to do this. This will be the second-last push before the final exercise of this module, which is a cooperation exercise. I will push again, because for some teachers (all of them) it wasn't clear how to use the Git.

## **Patch: 2.4.6.5**
*Branch: development*

------------------------------

### *Changes this patch:*
1. Workshop 1: Musicplayer
1. Workshop 2: Television
1. Workshop 3: Responsive

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Musicplayer
- In this workshop we made a musicplayer like Spotify, and I think I did pretty good. It was a fun challenge.

2. Television
- In this workshop we made a television screen where we played a YouTube video, and if a button was pressed it had to play a different video. There was a requirement to automatically play the video when opening the page, but since that isn't allowed anymore, I made it differently. This was, again a fun challenge, but the working with CSS for making the tv was harder than actually working with the video element (except for the autoplay).

3. Responsive
- This workshop was made to make us work with making sites responsive, but I already (partially) used this in my sites. It let us work with percentages, which I already did. I found out it's easier to work with the calc() function in CSS than actually calculating. However, it wasn't at first because I didn't get how the function worked. Once I found out it was pretty simple and easy.

## **Patch: 2.0.0.0**
*Branch: development*

------------------------------

### *Changes this patch:*
1. Module 3
1. Exercise 1: Webshop (WitWub)

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Module 3
- A wild new folder has appeared! I'll be working in this folder the coming weeks, it will hold all of the things I do for module 3.

2. WitWub
- Last module (module 2) we had a final exercise, which was making the webshop. This was frontend only, and now we have to expand. It will have to contain a couple more things, and not working with JavaScript is almost going to be impossible. I've been working on this for 3 days now (because I'm a little late with the first push/patch whoops). I've almost finished the detail page, and will finish the last things of that tomorrow. I also hope to make the most part of the order page, and possibly already start making the thank you page.

### *Changes this patch:*
1. Webshop

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Webshop
- I finished the webshop exercise, and it looks pretty good, if I do say so myself. There were a couple things I got stuck on, and I kind of wanted to make it actually working with the filters aswell, but that didn't work out in the end because I didn't have the time for it.

------------------------------

### **NOTE:**
This is the last push of this module. I had fun working on the things I did work on, such as solitaire and the webshop. See you next module!

1. Remote control
1. Overall layout

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Div work
- I've been working on the structure of the code for the different pages I've made. The code wasn't really optimal at certain points, such as multiple divs inside of eachother. When I was working on this, nothing really worked. I'll ask for help tomorrow.

2. Remote control
- As I said before, I was going to make this show where the computer is. Well, I did. It now makes the key where it is a little darker.

3. Overall layout
- I made a few adjustments to the code, to make it better. I made the navbar (template.css) ul's and li's more clear by adding the class "navbar". I also updated the colors of the navbar, they're now not red anymore, but more dark purple (#1f1e33, jaguar).

- I discovered that the home page (index.html) wasn't complete yet. Thus, I changed it, and now it completely fits into the rest of the site.

------------------------------

### **NOTE:**
The only thing I'm going to change is the remote control. I'm going to try to make it show at which key the computer is at that time.

- I've worked on the about me page, and will be working on this for the remainder of the week. I'm working mostly in JavaScript at the moment, because I want to print the different projects with this. Because of this, I'm also working with Json, which seemed like a little bit of a problem at first, but I managed to fix it. This was of course with the help of StackOverflow.

## **Patch: 0.1.2**
*Branch: **portfolio-exercises***

------------------------------

### *Updates this patch:*
1. Exercises
1. Standard pages
1. Remote control

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Exercises
- I forgot to change this log, so I'll put this here. I added the exercise "Wall" which was printing a wall using CSS and HTML. I made this using JavaScript because I like to make things harder than they have to be. It ended up okay, but I don't think I'll be diving any deeper into this particular exercise.

2. Standard pages
- This is for most of the pages. I changed the color scheme and fonts! They look better now, no more automatic font! I also made the navbar sticky, and added a footer. I deleted some items from the navbar, the "Account" option, which did nothing, and the "GLU elo" option, which sent us to... well, the GLU elo. But since I don't think it's important to have on my portfolio, I decided to delete it.

3. Remote control
- Made changes to the keyboard/remote control exercise. I added a feature called (sort of)(not really) AI! If the user types in a word and clicks the button, the computer will also type it! I've tested it and it works flawlessly. The only change more I want to make, is making it more clear where the computer is.
