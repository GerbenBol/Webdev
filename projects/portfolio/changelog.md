# *Explanation of project*
------------------------------
I've started this project because I was bored, and thus decided to just start working on a random webpage I could show. When I was put to work on some harder exercises I decided to make a portfolio out of it. I'm going to style it as I like it, and using Bootstrap is nice, so I don't have to make a carousel view out of nothing (for example). It's also an exercise for my JavaScript skills, which for now is looking a bit rough.

------------------------------

### *Changes this patch:*
1. Solitaire

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Solitaire
- We can finally move the cars to another stack! It then makes the card under the stack visible, and possible to grab. Going to be working on combining parts of stacks. Also found a bug in the showing of empty rows/rows with only 1 card left. Will try to fix that before next push (later today).

1. Solitaire
- I changed solitaire again, fixed the problem with undefined, so the board gets initialized correctly at least. Have also worked on printing the cards onto the screen. It almost works how I want it to. Have also begun working on the algorithm that gets activated when the player presses a stack/the new stacks.

1. Remote control
1. Overall layout

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Div work
- I've been working on the structure of the code for the different pages I've made. The code wasn't really optimal at certain points, such as multiple divs inside of eachother. When I was working on this, nothing really worked. I'll ask for help tomorrow.

2. Remote control
- As I said before, I was going to make this show where the computer is. Well, I did. It now makes the key where it is a little darker.

3. Overall layout
- I made a few adjustments to the code, to make it better. I made the navbar (template.css) ul's and li's more clear by adding the class "navbar". I also updated the colors of the navbar, they're now not red anymore, but more dark purple (#1f1e33, jaguar).

- I discovered that the home page (index.html) wasn't complete yet. Thus, I changed it, and now it completely fits into the rest of the site.

------------------------------

### **NOTE:**
The only thing I'm going to change is the remote control. I'm going to try to make it show at which key the computer is at that time.

2. About me
- I've worked on the about me page, and will be working on this for the remainder of the week. I'm working mostly in JavaScript at the moment, because I want to print the different projects with this. Because of this, I'm also working with Json, which seemed like a little bit of a problem at first, but I managed to fix it. This was of course with the help of StackOverflow.

## **Patch: 0.1.2**
*Branch: **portfolio-exercises***

------------------------------

### *Updates this patch:*
1. Exercises
1. Standard pages
1. Remote control

------------------------------

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Exercises
- I forgot to change this log, so I'll put this here. I added the exercise "Wall" which was printing a wall using CSS and HTML. I made this using JavaScript because I like to make things harder than they have to be. It ended up okay, but I don't think I'll be diving any deeper into this particular exercise.

2. Standard pages
- This is for most of the pages. I changed the color scheme and fonts! They look better now, no more automatic font! I also made the navbar sticky, and added a footer. I deleted some items from the navbar, the "Account" option, which did nothing, and the "GLU elo" option, which sent us to... well, the GLU elo. But since I don't think it's important to have on my portfolio, I decided to delete it.

3. Remote control
- Made changes to the keyboard/remote control exercise. I added a feature called (sort of)(not really) AI! If the user types in a word and clicks the button, the computer will also type it! I've tested it and it works flawlessly. The only change more I want to make, is making it more clear where the computer is.
