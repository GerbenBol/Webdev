# *Explanation of project*
------------------------------
I've started this project because I was bored, and thus decided to just start working
on a random webpage I could show. When I was put to work on some harder exercises I
decided to make a portfolio out of it. I'm going to style it as I like it, and using
Bootstrap is nice, so I don't have to make a carousel view out of nothing (for example).
It's also an exercise for my JavaScript skills, which for now is looking a bit rough.

### *More in-depth information*
------------------------------
1. Exercises
- I forgot to change this log, so I'll put this here. I added the exercise "Wall" which was printing a wall using CSS and HTML. I made this using JavaScript because I like to make things harder than they have to be. It ended up okay, but I don't think I'll be diving any deeper into this particular exercise.

2. Standard pages
- This is for most of the pages. I changed the color scheme and fonts! They look better now, no more automatic font! I also made the navbar sticky, and added a footer. I deleted some items from the navbar, the "Account" option, which did nothing, and the "GLU elo" option, which sent us to... well, the GLU elo. But since I don't think it's important to have on my portfolio, I decided to delete it.

3. Remote control
- Made changes to the keyboard/remote control exercise. I added a feature called (sort of)(not really) AI! If the user types in a word and clicks the button, the computer will also type it! I've tested it and it works flawlessly. The only change more I want to make, is making it more clear where the computer is.
