                                My name is Gerben Bol. I am a 18 years old kiddo living in Geertruidenberg.
                                I love playing video games, all kinds of them. Another passion of mine is
                                programming/ coding/ scripting/ whatever you'd like to call it. I've been
                                doing it since a year or 2/2.5 ago, and have been loving it. I also play
                                the trumpet.

                                You can often find me coding, sometimes for school,
                                but sometimes for different projects that I do. Those kinds of projects are
                                with friends a lot of the time. I also make games sometimes, but those never
                                get finished because I start 5 new projects in the meantime. In the end I
                                usually lose motivation to make the games.

For example, I made a WinForms application with
a friend of mine not that long ago. It is an app that lets you connect to a server,
and on that server you can play DnD (Dungeons & Dragons) with the other people on
that same server. We made the complete app, including server. It was made in C#,
because we're both quite confident in our skills in that.
