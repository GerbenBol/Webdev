                                My name is Gerben Bol. I am an 18-year-old living in <a class="nodec" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Geertruidenberg" target="_blank">
                                Geertruidenberg</a>. I love playing video games, all kinds of them. Another
                                passion of mine is programming/ coding/ scripting/ whatever you'd like to
                                call it. I've been doing it since a year or 2/2.5 ago, and have been loving
                                it. I'm pretty well-versed in the languages C# and PHP (if I do say so myself),
                                and I can do my share of HTML, CSS and JS as well. I also know a bit of SQL,
                                which is very impressive. Of course, I'm still learning, and I don't think
                                I'll ever stop doing that. I want to know all the coding languages that exist
                                (not really)! But what is true, is that I do want to learn a couple more languages.
                                For example, I want to learn C++. This is because it's almost identical to C#,
                                which I love, but it's more low-level, and sometimes that's better. I also
                                play the trumpet.

                            <h2><b>My projects</b></h2>
                            <p>
                                You can often find me coding, sometimes for school,
                                but sometimes for different projects that I do. Those kinds of projects are
                                with friends a lot of the time. I also make games sometimes, but those never
                                get finished because I start 5 new projects in the meantime. In the end I
                                usually lose motivation to make the games, which is a bummer a lot of the times.

                                Before I started studying at GLU, I did havo. After I got my diploma,
                                I started doing HBO at Fontys. I did software engineering/software
                                development there, but the study itself just wasn't for me. There, I did
                                learn some HTML, CSS, JS and PHP so I did have some knowledge before
                                I started.
