                                My name is Gerben Bol. I am an 18-year-old living in Geertruidenberg.
                                I love playing video games, all kinds of them. Another passion of mine is
                                programming/ coding/ scripting/ whatever you'd like to call it. I've been
                                doing it since a year or 2/2.5 ago, and have been loving it. I also play
                                the trumpet.

                                You can often find me coding, sometimes for school,
                                but sometimes for different projects that I do. Those kinds of projects are
                                with friends a lot of the time. I also make games sometimes, but those never
                                get finished because I start 5 new projects in the meantime. In the end I
                                usually lose motivation to make the games.

                                Before I started studying at GLU, I did havo. After I got my diploma,
                                I started doing a HBO at Fontys. I did software engineering/software
                                development there, but the study itself just wasn't for me. There, I did
                                learn some HTML, CSS, JS and PHP so I did have some knowledge before
                                I started.
